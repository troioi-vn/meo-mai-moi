GPT-4.1 recommendations:

After a thorough review of your Docker, Nginx, PHP-FPM, and Laravel setup, here are the most likely causes and actionable steps to resolve the persistent 502 Bad Gateway error:

1. **Socket Path Consistency**
   - Double-check that both Nginx (`fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;`) and PHP-FPM (`listen = /var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock` in `www.conf`) reference the exact same socket path. Even a minor typo or mismatch will break communication.

2. **Socket File Existence and Permissions**
   - After the container starts, exec into it and verify the socket file exists:
     ```bash
     ls -l /var/run/php-fpm/
     ```
   - The socket should be owned by `www-data:www-data` and have at least `660` permissions. If not, adjust your entrypoint script or PHP-FPM config.

3. **Process Status**
   - Ensure PHP-FPM is running and listening on the socket:
     ```bash
     ps aux | grep php-fpm
     ```
   - If PHP-FPM is not running, check `/tmp/entrypoint.log` and `/var/log/php-fpm.log` for errors.

4. **Nginx FastCGI Configuration**
   - Confirm that Nginx is loading the correct config file and that `fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;` resolves to the actual PHP file path. Misconfiguration here can cause Nginx to fail to pass requests to PHP-FPM.

5. **Entrypoint and Supervisor Startup Order**
   - Your entrypoint script creates the socket directory and sets permissions before starting Supervisor. Ensure Supervisor starts PHP-FPM before Nginx, or that both are started together and PHP-FPM is ready before Nginx begins handling requests.

6. **Database Configuration**
   - Your `.env` uses SQLite, but your Docker image installs Postgres drivers. If Laravel expects Postgres, update `.env` accordingly. If the app fails to boot due to DB config, PHP-FPM may not serve requests, resulting in a 502 error.

7. **Docker Volumes and SELinux/AppArmor**
   - If `/var/run/php-fpm` or other directories are mounted as Docker volumes, check for permission issues. Also, if SELinux or AppArmor is enabled, they may block socket creation or access.

8. **Logs and Debugging**
   - Always check Nginx error logs, PHP-FPM logs, and `/tmp/entrypoint.log` for clues. Increase verbosity if needed to capture more details.

9. **Test with TCP**
   - As a diagnostic step, revert to TCP (`127.0.0.1:9000`) in both Nginx and PHP-FPM configs. If this works, the issue is isolated to socket communication and permissions.

10. **Manual Container Debugging**
    - Temporarily override the entrypoint in `docker-compose.yml` to start a shell, then manually start PHP-FPM and Nginx to observe any errors in real time.

**Summary:**
Your configuration is correct for most scenarios. The persistent error is likely due to a runtime issue: socket not created, permissions, process crash, or a mismatch in config. The next step is to inspect the running container for the socket file, process status, and logs. If all else fails, revert to TCP for communication to isolate the problem.

If you need step-by-step commands or want to automate these checks, consider adding healthcheck scripts or more verbose logging to your containers.
