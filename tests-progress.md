### Current Situation Overview

**Backend Changes (Already Applied):**
*   **`backend/app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`**: Modified the `logout` method to ensure all user tokens are deleted, improving security and consistency.
*   **`backend/app/Http/Controllers/UserProfileController.php`**:
    *   Ensured the `/api/users/me` endpoint response is consistently wrapped in a `data` property, aligning with frontend expectations.
    *   Increased the maximum allowed avatar upload size from 2MB to 10MB.
*   **`backend/nginx-docker.conf`**: Updated `client_max_body_size` to 10MB to accommodate larger avatar uploads.
*   **`backend/storage/api-docs/api-docs.json`**: The OpenAPI documentation was updated to reflect the `data` wrapper for user profiles, ensuring API contract consistency.
*   **`/api/cats` Endpoint Removal**: The `/api/cats` GET endpoint (for fetching all cats) has been removed from the backend. This includes the corresponding controller method, API route, and OpenAPI documentation.

**Frontend Changes (Already Applied):**
*   **`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**: Correctly imported `csrf` to resolve a `ReferenceError`.
*   **`frontend/src/api/cats.ts`**: Corrected the `getMyCats` function to fetch data from the `/my-cats` endpoint instead of `/cats`, resolving a logical error in data retrieval.
*   **`frontend/src/setupTests.ts`**:
    *   Refined the `axios.create().post` mock for the login endpoint to return a response with the expected nested `data` structure, resolving `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')` during login.
    *   Explicitly exported `AxiosError` from the `axios` mock, addressing an unhandled error related to `AxiosError` not being defined.
    *   Ensured MSW handlers for `/api/cats` and `/api/my-cats` return data wrapped in a `data` property, resolving `TypeError: cats.filter is not a function` and `TypeError: cats.map is not a function` in related components.
*   **`CatsSection` Component Removal**: The `frontend/src/components/CatsSection.tsx` component and its associated test file `frontend/src/components/CatsSection.test.tsx` have been removed. The `CatsSection` import and usage in `frontend/src/pages/MainPage.tsx` have been commented out.
*   **Test Files (`.test.tsx` files)**:
    *   **`src/components/CatPhotoManager.test.tsx`**: Removed redundant `mockClear()` calls and added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions to ensure elements are present before checking.
    *   **`src/components/ChangePasswordForm.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/components/EnhancedCatRemovalModal.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/components/LoginForm.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/components/RegisterForm.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/components/test/AllTheProviders.tsx`**: Exported `testQueryClient` for broader test utility.
    *   **`src/components/ui/alert-dialog.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/components/ui/alert.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/components/ui/select.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/pages/ApplyToHelpPage.test.tsx`**: Imported `waitFor` and added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/pages/LoginPage.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/pages/MainPage.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/pages/NotFoundPage.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.
    *   **`src/pages/RegisterPage.test.tsx`**: Added `await waitFor` to rendering assertions.

### Remaining Issues and Proposed Solutions

Despite the progress, several tests are still failing. Here's a detailed look at each remaining issue and my plan to fix them:

1.  **`TypeError: cats.filter is not a function` in `MyCatsPage.tsx` (and similar `cats.map` errors in `App.routing.test.tsx`):**
    *   **Problem:** This error persists in `MyCatsPage.test.tsx` and `App.routing.test.tsx`, indicating that the `cats` variable is still not an array when `filter` or `map` is called. This is happening on line 72 of `MyCatsPage.tsx`.
    *   **Analysis:** While the MSW mocks now return data wrapped in `data`, the components might still be receiving `undefined` or `null` for `cats` initially, before the asynchronous data fetch completes.
    *   **Solution:** I will modify `MyCatsPage.tsx` to ensure `cats` is always initialized as an empty array (`[]`) and use optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing `cats` properties to prevent errors during initial render or while data is being fetched. I will also need to re-evaluate `App.routing.test.tsx` as its dependency on `CatsSection` is now removed.

2.  **`AssertionError: expected "spy" to be called with arguments: [ 'Cat has been marked as deceased' ] Number of calls: 0` in `src/components/EnhancedCatRemovalModal.test.tsx` (and similar for `handles API errors gracefully`):**
    *   **Problem:** The `toast.success` and `toast.error` spies are not being called, meaning the toast notifications are not being triggered as expected after API calls in `EnhancedCatRemovalModal`.
    *   **Analysis:** This suggests an issue with how `toast` is mocked or how the API calls are resolving/rejecting within the test environment.
    *   **Solution:** I will verify the `toast` mocking in `setupTests.ts` to ensure it correctly captures calls. I will also explicitly mock the `updateCatStatus` and `deleteCat` API calls in `src/mocks/handlers.ts` to ensure they resolve or reject with appropriate data, triggering the toast notifications.

3.  **`Unable to find a label with the text of: Breed` in `src/pages/account/CreateCatPage.test.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** The test cannot find the "Breed" label, indicating the form field might not be rendered or the query is incorrect.
    *   **Analysis:** This could be a timing issue where the component hasn't fully rendered the form elements before the query is made.
    *   **Solution:** I will ensure `await waitFor` is used around the `expect` statements that query for form elements in `CreateCatPage.test.tsx` to give the component enough time to render.

4.  **`Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="form-error"]` in `src/pages/account/CreateCatPage.test.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** The test cannot find the element with `data-testid="form-error"`.
    *   **Analysis:** The error message might not be rendered with this `data-testid` or it's not rendered at all.
    *   **Solution:** I will inspect `CreateCatPage.tsx` to confirm the `data-testid` attribute for the error message. If it's missing, I'll add it. If it's present, I'll ensure the error state is correctly triggered in the test.

5.  **`Unable to find an element with the display value: Fluffy.` in `src/pages/account/EditCatPage.test.tsx` (and similar for other display values):**
    *   **Problem:** The tests cannot find elements with specific display values, indicating that the form fields are not being pre-populated with cat data.
    *   **Analysis:** This is likely a timing issue or an issue with how the `getCat` API call is mocked or how the data is used to populate the form.
    *   **Solution:** I will ensure the `getCat` mock in `src/mocks/handlers.ts` returns the correct `mockCat` data. I will also add `await waitFor` around the assertions that check for display values in `EditCatPage.test.tsx`.

6.  **`Unable to find role="heading" and name /edit cat profile/i` in `src/pages/account/EditCatPage.test.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** The heading for the edit page is not found.
    *   **Analysis:** Similar to the previous rendering issues, this could be a timing issue.
    *   **Solution:** I will add `await waitFor` around the assertion for the heading in `EditCatPage.test.tsx`.

7.  **`act(...)` warnings:**
    *   **Problem:** These warnings indicate that state updates are happening outside of an `act()` block, which can lead to unpredictable test behavior.
    *   **Analysis:** While I've added `await waitFor` in many places, some asynchronous operations might still be causing state updates outside of `act`.
    *   **Solution:** I will systematically review the tests and wrap any asynchronous actions that cause state updates (e.g., `userEvent.click`, API calls) within `act(async () => { ... })` blocks where they are missing.
