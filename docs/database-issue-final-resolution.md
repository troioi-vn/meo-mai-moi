# Database Data Loss Issue - FULLY RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Identified

The database appeared to be getting "erased" after deploy, but actually:
- **Database schema (tables) persisted** ✅  
- **User data persisted** ✅
- **BUT system data was missing** ✅ (pet types, roles, permissions)

This happened because:
1. `docker compose down -v` was clearing everything (FIXED - now uses `docker compose stop`)
2. Seeders weren't auto-running on normal deploys
3. Without pet types (system data), the app couldn't function

## Solution Implemented

### Changed: `docker compose down` → `docker compose stop`
- Old: Removed containers, triggered fresh PostgreSQL initialization
- New: Stops containers, keeps database running
- Result: All data persists ✅

### Added: Automatic system data detection
The script now:
1. Runs migrations (`php artisan migrate`)
2. Checks if pet types (system data) exist
3. If missing → automatically seeds required system data
4. If `--fresh` or `--seed` → seeds everything

## How It Works Now

### Normal Deploy
```bash
./utils/deploy.sh
```
- Stops/starts containers (data preserved)
- Runs new migrations only
- Auto-detects and populates missing system data
- User data untouched

### Fresh Deploy
```bash
./utils/deploy.sh --fresh
```
- Asks for confirmation
- Removes everything
- Runs fresh migrations
- **Automatically seeds everything**

### Deploy with Sample Data
```bash
./utils/deploy.sh --seed
```
- Preserves data
- Runs migrations
- Seeds all sample data (users, pets, etc.)

## Why This Happened

The real root cause was a **misunderstanding of what data needs to persist:**

| Type | Examples | Persists After Deploy | Must Auto-Seed |
|------|----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| System Data | Pet types, roles, permissions | ❌ No (tables empty) | ✅ Yes - app needs it |
| User Data | Users, pets, placements | ✅ Yes (volume) | ❌ No - optional sample data |
| Migrations | Schema changes | ✅ Yes (run once) | N/A - idempotent |

## Testing

Verified:
1. ✅ Normal deploy preserves user data
2. ✅ Normal deploy auto-populates system data
3. ✅ Fresh deploy deletes everything and resedes
4. ✅ Schema tables persist across restarts

The issue is now **completely resolved**!
