### Changed

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed SQLite support entirely - PostgreSQL is now the only supported database
- Default database connection changed from SQLite to PostgreSQL in all environments
- Tests now run against PostgreSQL instead of SQLite in-memory database
- Queue and batching configuration updated to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite fallbacks
- Pet API: Deprecated strict required exact `birthday`; now optional and superseded by precision + component fields. Supplying legacy `birthday` alone auto-coerces precision=day.
- **Email Configuration:**
  - Both SMTP and Mailgun configurations now require test email address for sending test emails
  - Test connection action labels unified to "Send Test Email" for both providers
  - Email configuration seeder updated with dev.meo-mai-moi.com domain and pavel@catarchy.space test recipient
  - Enhanced email configuration validation to include optional test_email_address field

### Added

- PgAdmin interface for local database management
- Enhanced documentation for PostgreSQL-only development workflow
- Comprehensive frontend code quality improvements with 140+ ESLint fixes
- Support for approximate / unknown pet birthdays via `birthday_precision` enum (`day|month|year|unknown`) and component fields `birthday_year`, `birthday_month`, `birthday_day`; frontend form precision selector & age display helper.
- Notification Templates system (Phase 1-2):
  - Registry-driven notification types with channel support and variable docs (`backend/config/notification_templates.php`).
  - File-based defaults with locale fallbacks:
    - Email: Blade views at `emails.notifications.{locale}.{slug}` (legacy path supported).
    - In-App: Markdown at `resources/templates/notifications/bell/{locale}/{slug}.md`.
  - DB overrides via Filament admin resource (CRUD) with:
    - Full preview modal (email HTML, in-app text)
    - Compare with default (side-by-side)
    - Reset to default (removes override)
    - Send test email to logged-in admin
    - Type select populated from registry, channel-aware filtering, triggers browser modal
    - Prefill from defaults when selecting type/channel/locale
    - Filters and variable docs panel
  - Services: locale resolver, template resolver, renderer; email + in-app integration with safe fallbacks.
  - Seeder: `NotificationTemplateSeeder` seeds two inactive in-app overrides for quick discovery.
- **Email Configuration Enhancements**:
  - Added test email address field for Mailgun API configurations (matching existing SMTP functionality)
  - Test emails now create EmailLog entries and appear in admin panel at `/admin/email-logs`
  - Added `php artisan email:setup` command for quick configuration with domain-specific defaults
  - Enhanced email configuration validation to include test email address format checking
  - Added comprehensive email configuration documentation at `docs/email_configuration.md`

  - Improved test selectors to handle multiple elements correctly
  - Fixed missing test setup imports (`beforeAll`, `afterAll`)
  - All 6 test cases now pass successfully
- Maintained all existing functionality while significantly improving code quality
- **Email Configuration:** Fixed test email failures by adding missing `symfony/http-client` dependency required by Mailgun mailer
  - Added confirmation dialogs to email configuration delete actions to prevent accidental deletion
  - Improved empty state messaging in email configuration admin panel to guide users when no configurations are visible
- **Email Configuration Improvements:**
  - Fixed test emails not appearing in email logs by creating EmailLog entries for all test emails
  - Fixed inconsistent user experience between SMTP and Mailgun test email functionality
  - Improved error handling and user feedback for email configuration testing

### Unreleased (delta)

- **ðŸ”¥ HIGH IMPACT: Pet Photo Upload System Redesign**:
  - **Single Photo Logic**: Migrated pet photos from multi-photo to single photo system (like user avatars)
  - **Consistent UX**: Upload/Remove buttons now appear on pet edit page, not view page
  - **MediaLibrary Integration**: Backend now clears existing photos before adding new ones (single photo collection)
  - **Enhanced UI**: Upload and Remove buttons positioned below pet photo with clean styling
  - **API Improvements**: Added support for deleting "current" photo via `/pets/{id}/photos/current` endpoint
  - **Component Architecture**: Created reusable `PetPhoto` component with upload controls
  - **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for pet photo upload functionality (9 test cases)
  - **Removed Multi-Photo Support**: Simplified from complex multi-photo system to single photo (matching avatar pattern)
  - **Form Integration**: Removed photo upload from create/edit forms, moved to dedicated photo management on edit page
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained `photo_url` API field with proper MediaLibrary integration
- **Admin Panel Navigation Improvements**: Reorganized navigation groups for better clarity and usability:
  - Moved "Roles" from "Filament Shield" section to "System" section
  - Moved "Users" from "Filament Shield" section to "Users & Helpers" section as first item
  - Removed empty "Filament Shield" section
  - Moved "Pets" to top of "Pet Management" section
  - Renamed "User Access" section to "Invitation"
  - Updated navigation groups structure: Pet Management, Users & Helpers, Invitation, Communication, System
  - Published and customized UserResource for better control over navigation ordering
- Frontend: Added a prominent "Lost" status badge to `PetCard` and corresponding unit test to ensure the badge renders when `pet.status === 'lost'`.
- Frontend tests: Fixed typing for test helpers (added `MockUser` type) so tests accept a mock user object; all `PetCard` tests pass.
- Password flow: Moved password change UI to a dedicated `/account/password` page (`PasswordPage`), updated `ChangePasswordForm` to force logout and redirect to `/login` after a successful password change, and updated tests to assert logout/redirect behavior and adjusted copy.
- Profile page: Replaced inline password form with a link to the new password page and small UI polish for the password card.
- Create/Edit Pet page: Added edit-mode improvements: navigation back button, photo preview for current pet photo in edit mode, and redirect to the pet profile after status updates.
- Frontend package: changed test script to run `vitest run` (removed `--silent` flag) to surface test output during runs.
- Documentation: Removed several backend docs files (notification-related docs, OpenAPI dump, unsubscribe, send-email job, and other legacy docs) as part of documentation cleanup.
- Repo config: Tweaked `.gitignore` and updated `backend/.env.docker` handling (dev docker env changes).

### Changed

- SPA-only UI: Removed dependency on server-rendered Inertia pages and ensured all non-JSON auth responses redirect into the SPA
- Web routes updated to redirect reset-password and email verification flows into SPA routes where applicable
- Backend configured as API-first for UI flows; Jetstream retained only for API features (tokens, 2FA) with views disabled
- Frontend tests and setup streamlined: improved mocking for `sonner` and added reset password page tests

### Removed

- Inertia/Vue UI from the backend (no backend JS/Vite build used to serve UI)
- Backend Node/Vite/Tailwind tooling tied to Inertia UI (kept out of runtime; see docs/inertia_remove.md)
