# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on preparing the existing pet management application for internationalization (i18n) support. The goal is to establish a robust foundation with quality gates, testing infrastructure, and architectural improvements before implementing actual multilanguage functionality. This preparation phase ensures the codebase is maintainable, well-tested, and ready for translation without introducing technical debt.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Quality Assurance Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive quality gates and metrics in place, so that I can confidently refactor code for i18n without introducing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the baseline metrics are established THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports for both backend (PHPUnit) and frontend (Vitest) with per-namespace/directory breakdowns
2. WHEN static analysis is configured THEN the system SHALL enforce PHPUnit level 7+ and strict TypeScript compilation without errors
3. WHEN dependency analysis is implemented THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent forbidden cross-layer dependencies via Deptrac and dependency-cruiser
4. WHEN pre-commit hooks are active THEN the system SHALL run linting, type checking, and formatting validation before each commit
5. WHEN security scanning is enabled THEN the system SHALL detect secrets, vulnerabilities, and license issues in CI

### Requirement 2: Test Infrastructure Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust and fast test suite, so that I can refactor confidently and catch regressions early during i18n implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend tests are restructured THEN the system SHALL separate unit, integration, and feature tests with appropriate database handling strategies
2. WHEN frontend tests are standardized THEN the system SHALL use centralized test utilities and MSW server setup for consistent API mocking
3. WHEN E2E tests are implemented THEN the system SHALL cover critical user flows (auth, invitations, pet management) with Playwright
4. WHEN approval tests are added THEN the system SHALL baseline current email templates and notification formats for regression detection
5. WHEN parallel testing is enabled THEN the system SHALL run tests consistently without flakiness

### Requirement 3: Internationalization Architecture Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want i18n-ready architecture in place, so that adding new languages requires minimal code changes and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LocaleContext service is implemented THEN the system SHALL resolve user locale from preferences, Accept-Language header, or default fallback
2. WHEN translation infrastructure is established THEN the system SHALL support key-based translations with variable substitution for emails and notifications
3. WHEN frontend i18n foundation is ready THEN the system SHALL lazy-load locale resources and enforce translation key usage over hardcoded strings
4. WHEN template system is abstracted THEN the system SHALL render emails using translation keys and variable maps instead of inline text
5. WHEN locale switching is supported THEN the system SHALL update UI text dynamically without page refresh

### Requirement 4: Code Quality and Architecture Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean architectural boundaries and extracted business logic, so that i18n changes don't require touching controller logic or violating separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business logic is extracted THEN the system SHALL move embedded controller logic into dedicated Service classes
2. WHEN layer boundaries are enforced THEN the system SHALL prevent direct dependencies between presentation, business, and data layers
3. WHEN formatting is centralized THEN the system SHALL use single modules for date, number, age, and weight display formatting
4. WHEN Services return domain values THEN the system SHALL avoid returning pre-formatted user-facing strings from business logic
5. WHEN global helpers are isolated THEN the system SHALL remove or abstract helpers that return user-facing text

### Requirement 5: Translation Data Strategy and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable fallback behavior and monitoring for translation issues, so that users always see appropriate content even when translations are missing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation keys are missing THEN the system SHALL log the missing key and display fallback content
2. WHEN unsupported locales are requested THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default locale gracefully
3. WHEN translation errors occur THEN the system SHALL include locale context in logs for debugging
4. WHEN email notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL use the recipient's preferred locale or fall back appropriately
5. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL track translation key usage and identify orphaned keys

### Requirement 6: Development Workflow and Tooling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tooling and clear workflows, so that maintaining translations and code quality requires minimal manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nightly jobs run THEN the system SHALL scan for unused translation keys and run mutation testing
2. WHEN new branches are created THEN the system SHALL identify newly introduced translation keys for review
3. WHEN contributors need guidance THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for translation workflows and key naming conventions
4. WHEN quality gates are checked THEN the system SHALL enforce coverage thresholds and architectural boundaries in CI
5. WHEN second locale is added THEN the system SHALL validate lazy loading and UI updates work correctly

### Requirement 7: Success Criteria and Validation

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want clear success criteria and validation steps, so that I can confidently approve the transition to actual multilanguage implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all quality gates are implemented THEN the system SHALL pass coverage thresholds, static analysis, and linting without violations
2. WHEN E2E suite is stable THEN the system SHALL complete at least 10 consecutive successful test runs
3. WHEN architecture boundaries are validated THEN the system SHALL pass Deptrac rules with zero violations
4. WHEN email system is ready THEN the system SHALL pass approval tests using translation keys instead of hardcoded text
5. WHEN second locale scaffold is added THEN the system SHALL demonstrate working locale switching with partial translations
