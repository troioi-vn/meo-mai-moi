# Email Notifications System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing in-app notification system by adding email notification capabilities. Users will be able to receive notifications via email in addition to the current bell notifications, with granular control over their notification preferences. The system will support multiple email providers (SMTP and Mailgun) configurable through the admin panel, and use file-based templates for future multilingual support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Email Provider Configuration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure email providers through the Filament admin panel, so that I can choose between SMTP and Mailgun for sending notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the Filament admin config section THEN the system SHALL display email provider configuration options
2. WHEN configuring SMTP THEN the system SHALL require host, port, username, password, encryption, and from address fields
3. WHEN configuring Mailgun THEN the system SHALL require API key, domain, and from address fields
4. WHEN saving email provider configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration before storing
5. IF email provider configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
6. WHEN email provider is configured THEN the system SHALL allow testing the connection with a test email

### Requirement 2: Email Notification Templates

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want email notification templates to be file-based, so that I can support multiple languages in the future and maintain consistent messaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system sends email notifications THEN it SHALL use file-based templates stored in the application
2. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL support the following notification types:
   - Owner: Response to Placement Request (helper profile group)
   - Owner: Placement Request Accepted (helper profile group)
   - Helper: Helper response accepted (helper profile group)
   - Helper: Helper response rejected (helper profile group)
3. WHEN rendering email templates THEN the system SHALL support dynamic content injection (user names, cat details, etc.)
4. WHEN templates are missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to a default template or plain text message
5. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL not require application restart to use new templates

### Requirement 3: User Notification Preferences

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control my notification preferences for both email and in-app notifications, so that I can receive notifications through my preferred channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their account page THEN the system SHALL display a notifications section
2. WHEN viewing notification preferences THEN the system SHALL show a table with notification types and two checkbox columns (email and in-app)
3. WHEN a user toggles email notifications for a type THEN the system SHALL save the preference immediately
4. WHEN a user toggles in-app notifications for a type THEN the system SHALL save the preference immediately
5. WHEN notification preferences are saved THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback of the save operation
6. WHEN the system sends notifications THEN it SHALL respect the user's preferences for each notification type
7. IF a user has disabled email notifications for a type THEN the system SHALL NOT send email notifications for that type
8. IF a user has disabled in-app notifications for a type THEN the system SHALL NOT create in-app notifications for that type

### Requirement 4: Email Notification Delivery

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive email notifications for important events, so that I stay informed even when not actively using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification event occurs THEN the system SHALL check the user's email notification preferences
2. IF email notifications are enabled for the event type THEN the system SHALL queue an email notification
3. WHEN sending email notifications THEN the system SHALL use the configured email provider (SMTP or Mailgun)
4. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and update the notification record
5. WHEN email delivery succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the notification record with delivery timestamp
6. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL include unsubscribe functionality
7. WHEN a user clicks unsubscribe THEN the system SHALL disable email notifications for that user

### Requirement 5: Notification Management Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the email notification system to integrate seamlessly with the existing notification system, so that I have a consistent experience across all notification channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating notifications THEN the system SHALL create both in-app and email notifications based on user preferences
2. WHEN displaying notification history THEN the system SHALL show delivery status for both in-app and email notifications
3. WHEN a notification is marked as read in-app THEN it SHALL not affect the email notification status
4. WHEN viewing notification details THEN the system SHALL show whether the notification was sent via email and its delivery status
5. WHEN notification preferences change THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future notifications immediately

### Requirement 6: Admin Notification Monitoring

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor email notification delivery and failures, so that I can ensure the system is working properly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin panel THEN administrators SHALL see email notification statistics and delivery rates
2. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for admin review
3. WHEN viewing notification records THEN administrators SHALL see delivery status, timestamps, and failure reasons
4. WHEN email provider configuration changes THEN the system SHALL test the new configuration before applying it
5. WHEN there are delivery issues THEN administrators SHALL receive alerts about system problems
