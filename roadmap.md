## Development Roadmap (DRAFT - PlacementRequest Architecture)

This document outlines the strategic development plan for the Meo Mai Moi project. For a history of the original user stories, see `tmp/user_stories.md`.

**MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE:** This roadmap incorporates the new PlacementRequest model architecture, which separates cat life status from placement needs, providing a more logical and scalable system.

## Breaking Changes Summary


### Database Changes
- **`Cat` Model:** Now uses status enum: `active`, `lost`, `deceased`, `deleted` (was: available/fostered/adopted/dead). Represents the cat's permanent biological and descriptive information.
    - TODO: checkbox "unknown_birthday" (boolean, nullable): Indicates if the birth date is unknown. (`birthday` still could be saved as aproximate date for age calculation)
    - TODO: add small `~` symbol to indicate approximate dates in the UI.
    - TODO: add checkbox "is_neutered" (boolean, nullable): Indicates if the cat is neutered.
- **New table**: `placement_requests`
- **Updated**: `transfer_requests` adds `placement_request_id` foreign key

### API Changes
- **Modified**: `GET /api/cats` filtering logic (no longer filters by placement status)
- **New endpoints**: PlacementRequest CRUD operations
- **Modified**: `POST /api/transfer-requests` requires `placement_request_id`

### Frontend Changes
- **All cat status displays** need updating
- **"Grab This Cat" button** replaced with placement-specific interactions
- **New UI components** for placement request management
- **Updated cat filtering** logic throughout the application

## Frontend Test Refactoring

The following test files need to be reviewed and refactored to align with the new testing architecture outlined in `GEMINI.md`. The goal is to ensure all tests use the global MSW server, the `renderWithRouter` utility, and centralized mock data.

- Centralized Mock Data and Handlers:
Moving all mock data (like mockUser) to a shared location and using global MSW handlers ensures consistency, maintainability, and alignment with your GEMINI.md testing strategy.

- Robust UI Feedback and Navigation Testing:
For UI feedback (like toasts) and navigation, direct DOM assertions can be unreliable due to portals or router limitations. Mocking external modules (e.g., sonner for toasts, useNavigate for navigation) and asserting their calls is the most reliable and maintainable approach.

- ESM Mocking Limitations Require Module Mocks:
Vitest (and other ESM-based test runners) cannot spy on named exports directly. Instead, you must use vi.mock to mock entire modules and their methods, which is essential for testing side effects in modern React apps.
