# Meo Mai Moi - Project Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Meo Mai Moi project.

## About the Project

Meo Mai Moi is an open-source web application engine designed to help communities build and manage local cat rehoming networks. It connects cat owners, fosters, and adopters in a seamless, community-driven platform.

Our primary goal is a geographically modular system anyone can deploy for their own city or region.
