feat(auth): stabilize frontend auth and fix module resolution

This commit addresses a series of critical frontend issues that were causing the application to fail on startup. The primary focus was on resolving module import/export errors and stabilizing the authentication system.

Key changes include:
- Fixed incorrect export of `buttonVariants` from the `button` component.
- Resolved persistent "User type not found" errors by correcting import paths in `AuthContext.tsx` to use the `@/` alias and ensuring type-only imports.
- Added the missing `React` import to `AuthContext.tsx` to fix a "React is not defined" reference error.
- Refactored the authentication-related type definitions and hooks into separate, more organized files (`use-auth.ts`, `auth-context.ts`, etc.) to improve code structure and maintainability.
- Updated `GEMINI.md` with a summary of the frontend authentication architecture.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the recent fixes and refactoring.
