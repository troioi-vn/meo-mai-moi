feat: Resolve Docker 502, login, and asset loading issues

This commit addresses several critical issues in the Dockerized environment and frontend asset loading:

- **Resolved 502 Bad Gateway Error:**
  - Removed conflicting PHP-FPM configurations (`www.conf.default`, `zz-docker.conf`) from the Dockerfile.
  - Configured Nginx to use a Unix socket for PHP-FPM communication.
  - Adjusted Supervisor and PHP-FPM configurations for proper socket listening and process management.
  - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to correctly load environment variables for the backend service.

- **Fixed 500 Internal Server Error on Login:**
  - Executed Laravel database migrations (`php artisan migrate --force`) to create necessary tables in the PostgreSQL database.
  - Seeded the database (`php artisan db:seed --force`) with initial data, including a test user.

- **Corrected Missing Default Avatar Image:**
  - Modified `frontend/package.json` to include `npm run assets:copy` in the `build:docker` script, ensuring frontend assets are copied to the backend's public directory during Docker builds.
  - Updated frontend components (`UserAvatar.tsx`, `UserMenu.tsx`) to correctly import the default avatar asset.

- **Other Improvements:**
  - Added debugging tools (`procps`, `net-tools`) to the backend Dockerfile.
  - Updated `welcome.blade.php` to reflect the latest frontend asset paths.
  - Added a task to `roadmap.md` to update the Node.js version.
