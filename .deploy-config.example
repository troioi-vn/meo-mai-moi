# Deployment branch configuration overrides
# Copy to .deploy-config and adjust as needed

# Explicit branches per environment
#DEPLOY_BRANCH_PRODUCTION=main
#DEPLOY_BRANCH_STAGING=staging
#DEPLOY_BRANCH_DEVELOPMENT=dev

# Alternatively, you can use the environment-specific uppercase variable name directly
# e.g., DEPLOY_BRANCH_PRODUCTION will be picked up by the deploy script.
