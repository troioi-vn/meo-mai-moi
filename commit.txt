feat(frontend): implement UI beautification and shadcn/ui theme

This commit introduces a major overhaul of the frontend UI, implementing the design principles outlined in `GEMINI.md`. The primary goal was to create a more modern, consistent, and visually appealing user experience.

Key changes include:
- **Integration of shadcn/ui:** Replaced many custom components with `shadcn/ui` components, which are added directly to the codebase for full control and customization.
- **New Theming System:** Implemented a new theme system based on CSS variables, configured through `tailwind.config.js`. This provides a consistent color palette, typography, and spacing across the application.
- **Dark Mode:** Added a theme provider and toggle for dark mode support.
- **Component Refactoring:** Refactored most of the existing components (buttons, forms, cards, navigation, etc.) to align with the new design system.
- **Asset Addition:** Added new image assets for the hero section.
- **Dependency Updates:** Updated frontend dependencies to support the new UI framework.

This extensive update significantly improves the aesthetics and usability of the application, laying a solid foundation for future feature development.
