# Test Stability Baseline Report

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Purpose:** Establish test suite stability baseline before multilanguage/i18n implementation

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **Backend:** 3/3 runs passed with 100% consistency (575 tests, 2129 assertions each run)  
‚úÖ **Frontend:** 3/3 runs passed with 100% consistency (297 tests across 50 test files)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Backend Timing Variance:** High (59s ‚Üí 121s, 104% increase between fastest/slowest)  
‚úÖ **Frontend Timing:** Stable (~9.5-9.8s, <4% variance)  
üîç **Flaky Tests Detected:** None

**Conclusion:** Test suites are stable and ready for i18n work. Backend timing variance requires investigation but doesn't block development.

## Backend Test Results

### Run Summary
| Run | Status | Tests | Assertions | Time | Memory | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|------------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 (with Xdebug coverage) | ‚úÖ PASS | 575 | 2129 | 01:18.783 | 171.00 MB | Full coverage instrumentation |
| 2 (no coverage) | ‚úÖ PASS | 575 | 2129 | 00:59.097 | 163.00 MB | Fastest run |
| 3 (no coverage) | ‚úÖ PASS | 575 | 2129 | 02:00.720 | 163.00 MB | Slowest run (2x Run 2) |

### Key Observations

**Stability:**
- ‚úÖ Zero test failures across all runs
- ‚úÖ Consistent assertion count (2129 each run)
- ‚úÖ No flaky tests detected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 29 PHPUnit deprecation warnings (consistent across runs)

**Performance:**
- Average runtime (without coverage): 01:29.91
- Timing variance: 104% difference between fastest (59s) and slowest (121s) run
- Coverage overhead: ~33% increase when Xdebug enabled (79s vs 59-121s)

**Possible Causes for Timing Variance:**
1. Database seeding/migrations reset timing inconsistency
2. Container resource contention (CPU/memory fluctuation)
3. External service mocks not properly isolated
4. Cache warming differences between runs
5. Parallel execution or test order affecting timing

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Profile Run 3 to identify slow tests causing 2x slowdown
- [ ] Consider `--order-by=defects` or `--order-by=random` for test order stability
- [ ] Add `--testdox` or `--verbose` timing output to identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Investigate if Docker resource limits are hit during Run 3
- [ ] Consider parallel test execution (Laravel Parallel) if timing critical

## Frontend Test Results

### Run Summary
| Run | Status | Test Files | Tests | Duration | Transform | Setup | Collect | Tests Time | Environment | Prepare |
|-----|--------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|-------|---------|------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | ‚úÖ PASS | 50 | 297 | 9.84s | 3.94s | 18.89s | 27.85s | 36.68s | 28.27s | 6.02s |
| 2 | ‚úÖ PASS | 50 | 297 | 9.79s | 3.46s | 17.04s | 27.23s | 38.42s | 26.98s | 5.95s |
| 3 | ‚úÖ PASS | 50 | 297 | 9.46s | 3.65s | 16.48s | 27.15s | 36.43s | 26.85s | 6.01s |

### Key Observations

**Stability:**
- ‚úÖ Perfect consistency: 50 test files, 297 tests passed every run
- ‚úÖ No flaky tests detected
- ‚úÖ Very stable timing (<4% total variance)

**Performance:**
- Average runtime: 9.70s
- Timing variance: 3.9% (380ms range across 3 runs)
- Most time-consuming phases:
  - Test execution: 36-38s aggregate
  - Environment setup: 27-28s
  - Module collection: 27s

**Notable Test Timings (from Run 1 sample):**
- MainPageIntegration: ~300-423ms (most expensive single test)
- HelperProfilePage: ~279-329ms
- ProfilePage: ~290ms
- App.routing: ~231-271ms
- NotificationsPage: ~158-233ms

**Recommended Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Suite is production-ready; no immediate action required
- [ ] Optional: Enable `--reporter=verbose` for per-test timing tracking
- [ ] Optional: Add slowness threshold alert in CI (fail if >12s)

## Flakiness Assessment

### Methodology
- Backend: 3 consecutive full runs without parallelization
- Frontend: 3 consecutive full runs with default Vitest concurrency
- No test order randomization applied (future consideration)

### Results
**Flaky Tests Found:** 0

**Criteria Used:**
- Any test passing in some runs but failing in others
- Assertion count variance
- Unexpected errors or warnings

**Conclusion:** Both suites exhibit deterministic behavior suitable for i18n refactoring work.

## Comparison to Initial Baseline

### Backend
- Initial (Oct 7): 45.8s without coverage *(NOTE: likely measurement error or different subset)*
- Current average: 89.9s without coverage (59s-121s range)
- **Action:** Re-baseline with controlled environment; earlier measurement may have been feature-only subset

### Frontend
- Initial (Oct 7): ~297 tests observed
- Current: 297 tests (consistent)
- Coverage: 71.58% statements (unchanged)

---

## Known Issues & Deprecations

### PHPUnit Deprecations (29 warnings, consistent)
These deprecations appear in every run and should be addressed before PHPUnit 12:

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Audit deprecation warnings with `--display-warnings`
- [ ] Create follow-up issue for PHPUnit 11 ‚Üí 12 migration prep
- [ ] Update deprecated assertion methods/patterns

---

## Recommendations for i18n Implementation Phase

### Pre-Flight Checklist
- ‚úÖ Test suites stable and consistent
- ‚úÖ Coverage baseline established
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend timing variance needs monitoring during refactor
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PHPUnit deprecations should be resolved in parallel track

### Suggested Test Strategy During i18n Work
1. **Run backend tests before each commit** (use faster ~60s baseline)
2. **Run frontend tests in watch mode** (fast feedback loop)
3. **Add translation key coverage tests** as i18n keys introduced
4. **Maintain or improve current coverage** (set as CI threshold)
5. **Monitor for new flaky tests** introduced by locale switching logic

### Risk Mitigation
- If backend timing increases beyond 3 minutes, investigate immediately
- Add explicit test for locale context initialization
- Create approval tests for translated email templates
- Ensure test database seeding includes multi-locale fixtures
