# Meo Mai Moi - Project Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Meo Mai Moi project.

## About the Project

Meo Mai Moi is an open-source web application engine designed to help communities build and manage local cat rehoming networks. It provides the tools to connect cat owners, fosters, and adopters in a seamless, community-driven platform.

Our primary goal is to create a geographically modular system that anyone can deploy for their own city or region.

## Project Planning & Technical Details

The core technical design, data models, and development roadmap for this project are managed in our primary planning document. This document serves as the single source of truth for our development process.

-   For the architecture, tech stack, and phased plan, see the agent/architecture guide: [GEMINI.md](../GEMINI.md).
