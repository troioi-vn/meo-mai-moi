This commit finalizes several backend features and ensures comprehensive API documentation:

- **Cat Model Updates**: Replaced `age` with `birthday` and added `status` field.
- **TransferRequest Model Updates**: Added `fostering_type` and `price` fields.
- **TransferRequestController**: Implemented `store` method for creating transfer requests with proper validation and authorization.
- **Notification Integration**: Ensured notifications are sent to cat owners upon new transfer requests.
- **Cat Photo Management**: Implemented endpoints for uploading and deleting cat photos, including `CatPhoto` model, migration, and `CatPhotoController`.
- **User Avatar Management**: Implemented endpoints for uploading and deleting user avatars, including `avatar_url` column in `users` table, `FileUploadService` updates, and `UserProfileController` methods.
- **Messaging Feature**: Implemented secure in-app messaging with `Message` model, `MessageController`, and API routes for sending, listing, retrieving, marking as read, and deleting messages.
- **Helper Offers Filtering**: Confirmed `HelperProfileController` already supports filtering and sorting helper offers.
- **API Documentation and Integration**: Completed detailed Swagger (OpenAPI) annotations for all new and existing endpoints across `AuthController`, `UserProfileController`, `CatController`, `CatPhotoController`, `MessageController`, and `HelperProfileController`.
- **API Contract Testing**: Implemented automated contract testing to ensure API documentation freshness.
- **Tests**: Updated relevant tests (`CatListingTest`, `TransferRequestTest`, `ApiContractTest`) to reflect model and API changes.
- **Documentation**: Updated `GEMINI.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect all new features and changes.
