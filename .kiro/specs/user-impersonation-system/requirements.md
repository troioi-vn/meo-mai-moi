# User Impersonation System Requirements

## Introduction

The User Impersonation System allows administrators to temporarily assume the identity of other users for support, testing, and troubleshooting purposes. This system maintains security while providing administrators with the ability to experience the platform from any user's perspective.

## Glossary

- **Impersonation_System**: The complete user impersonation functionality
- **Admin_User**: A user with admin or super_admin role permissions
- **Target_User**: The user being impersonated by an administrator
- **Impersonation_Session**: An active session where an admin is viewing the platform as another user
- **Admin_Panel**: The Filament-based administrative interface
- **Main_App**: The primary user-facing application interface

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to impersonate any user account, so that I can troubleshoot issues and provide better support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin_User accesses the user management table, THE Impersonation_System SHALL display an impersonation action for each user
2. WHEN an Admin_User clicks the impersonation action, THE Impersonation_System SHALL switch the session to the Target_User's perspective
3. WHERE the Admin_User has super_admin or admin role, THE Impersonation_System SHALL allow impersonation of any user
4. THE Impersonation_System SHALL maintain the original Admin_User's session data during impersonation
5. THE Impersonation_System SHALL prevent non-admin users from accessing impersonation functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator who is impersonating a user, I want clear visual indicators of my impersonation status, so that I always know I'm in impersonation mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE an Admin_User is impersonating another user, THE Impersonation_System SHALL display a visual indicator in the Main_App navigation
2. THE Impersonation_System SHALL show the Target_User's name in the impersonation indicator
3. THE Impersonation_System SHALL provide a prominent "Stop Impersonating" button in the navigation
4. THE Impersonation_System SHALL use distinct visual styling (warning colors) for impersonation indicators
5. WHEN the Target_User lacks admin permissions, THE Impersonation_System SHALL hide admin-only interface elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator who is impersonating a user, I want to easily return to my admin account, so that I can quickly switch between user support and administrative tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE impersonating a Target_User, THE Impersonation_System SHALL provide an admin panel access link for the original Admin_User
2. WHEN an Admin_User clicks "Stop Impersonating", THE Impersonation_System SHALL immediately end the impersonation session
3. WHEN impersonation ends, THE Impersonation_System SHALL restore the original Admin_User's session
4. THE Impersonation_System SHALL refresh user-specific data when impersonation ends
5. THE Impersonation_System SHALL provide success feedback when impersonation is terminated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want secure impersonation controls, so that the system maintains security while allowing necessary support functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Impersonation_System SHALL verify Admin_User permissions before allowing impersonation
2. THE Impersonation_System SHALL prevent impersonation of other admin users by non-super-admin users
3. THE Impersonation_System SHALL log impersonation events for audit purposes
4. THE Impersonation_System SHALL maintain session security during impersonation transitions
5. IF an impersonation session becomes invalid, THEN THE Impersonation_System SHALL safely return to the original Admin_User session

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want API endpoints for impersonation management, so that the frontend can properly handle impersonation state and controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Impersonation_System SHALL provide an API endpoint to check current impersonation status
2. THE Impersonation_System SHALL provide an API endpoint to terminate impersonation sessions
3. WHEN checking impersonation status, THE Impersonation_System SHALL return both impersonator and impersonated user information
4. THE Impersonation_System SHALL require authentication for all impersonation API endpoints
5. THE Impersonation_System SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes for impersonation operations
