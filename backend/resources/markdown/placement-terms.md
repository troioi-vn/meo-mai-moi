# Placement Terms & Conditions

By submitting this placement request I confirm and agree to the following:

1. **I am authorized to place this pet.**
   I am the legal owner or an authorized caretaker of the pet. I will not submit placement requests for animals I do not have the right to place.

2. **All information is honest and complete.**
   I will provide accurate details about the pet's age, sex, health, behavior, vaccination status, and any special needs. I will update the request if any important facts change.

3. **Health & vaccinations are disclosed.**
   I will disclose known illnesses, injuries, or contagious conditions. Unvaccinated or ill animals may be posted, but their status must be clearly stated in the request.

4. **Care requirement.**
   I will only place the pet into a home that I believe will meet its needs. I understand helpers and adopters may ask questions, meet the pet, and perform checks before accepting.

5. **Meetings & transfers.**
   All meetings and handovers are the responsibility of the users involved. I will arrange a safe meeting place and follow basic safety precautions. Any agreement to transfer ownership or foster care is between the people involved — the platform only facilitates connections.

6. **No guarantees.**
   The platform does not guarantee placement, the suitability of responders, or outcomes. We do not inspect homes — users should judge suitability themselves and may request references or verification.

7. **Background checks & verification.**
   I consent to the platform's optional verification steps (e.g., ID checks, references). I understand the platform may show verification badges but this is not a guarantee.

8. **Reporting & follow-up.**
   I will inform the platform of any serious issues related to the placement (e.g., abandonment, harm) so we can take appropriate action.

9. **Photos & privacy.**
   I grant the platform permission to display (and, with my consent, promote) photos and information from this listing for the purpose of finding a helper or adopter. I will not post private information (personal addresses, financial details).

10. **Fees & donations.**
    If donations, promoted listings, or paid features are used, I agree to the platform's payment terms and fees. Any direct financial agreement between users is their responsibility.

11. **Liability & indemnity.**
    I accept responsibility for the accuracy of my listing and for decisions I make in arranging care or transfer. I release the platform from liability for disputes, injury, or loss arising from placements, except where local law says otherwise.

12. **Local laws & humane treatment.**
    I agree to follow all applicable local laws regarding animal transfer, and I commit to humane treatment of the animal at all times.

13. **Changes & contact.**
    The platform may update these terms; the current version will be available on the site. For questions or to report issues, I will contact the platform support.
