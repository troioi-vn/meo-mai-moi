# Meo Mai Moi — Cat Rehoming Platform Engine

## About

**Meo Mai Moi** is an open-source web application engine designed to help communities build cat rehoming networks. This platform connects cat owners who need to rehome their cats with individuals offering temporary or permanent homes. It supports fostering, adoption, and community-driven cat welfare.

Anyone can deploy this system in their area or country to run their own version of a cat rehoming service — whether for a city, province, or entire country. While the default geography data is based on Vietnam, it is fully adaptable to other regions.

## Key Features

- 👤 **User Profiles:** For both cat owners and fosters/adopters.
- 🐱 **Cat Listings:** Create detailed profiles for each cat, including health, temperament, and needs.
- 📄 **Questionnaires:** Tailored forms to help match cats with the right homes or fosters.
- 📍 **Location-based Search:** Using regional data (provinces and cities) for accurate matching.
- 💌 **In-app Messaging:** Communicate directly within the platform.
- ⭐ **Reputation System:** Reviews and ratings to build community trust.
- 🌏 **Multilingual Support:** Supports multiple languages, including English and Vietnamese.
- 🚩 **Modular Geography:** Easily adaptable to different countries' administrative regions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (planned default), with static JSON optionally used for initial geography data
- **Deployment:** Docker Compose for local and production environments

## Intended Use

This project is designed to be a **starter engine** for communities, NGOs, shelters, or independent groups who want to:

- Run a cat rehoming platform specific to their locality
- Manage temporary fostering networks
- Help with adoption processes
- Provide a safe, reputation-based environment for people and cats to find each other

The system is not tied to any specific country, though the initial dataset is based on Vietnam.
