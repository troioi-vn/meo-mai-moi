# Summary of Troubleshooting Session

This document outlines a series of issues encountered while preparing the application for a release. The initial goal was to squash database migrations and finalize the release, but it led to a cascade of environment and startup problems.

## 1. Initial State & Goal

The session began after a previous operation had successfully squashed all Laravel migrations into a single PostgreSQL schema file (`pgsql-schema.sql`). The goal was to verify this new setup and commit the changes.

## 2. Problem: Database Connection Race Condition

Upon starting the Docker environment, the `backend` container failed to start correctly.

*   **Symptom:** Logs showed the container exiting with a `SQLSTATE[08006] [7] connection to server at "db" ... failed: timeout expired` error during the `php artisan migrate` step.
*   **Root Cause:** The `backend` container was starting and attempting to run migrations before the `db` (PostgreSQL) container was fully initialized and ready to accept connections. The startup script (`docker-entrypoint.sh`) used a `pg_isready` check, which was too basicâ€”it only confirmed the Postgres process was running, not that the application database was ready for use.

## 3. Solution: Robust Database Readiness Check

To fix the race condition, the database readiness check was made more reliable.

*   **Action:** The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script was modified. The `until pg_isready ...` loop was replaced with an `until psql ... -c '\q'` loop.
*   **Reasoning:** This new command attempts a full connection to the specific application database. It only succeeds when the database is truly ready to be used by Laravel, thus resolving the race condition.

## 4. Interlude: Network Failure During Build

While applying the fix, a new, unrelated problem occurred.

*   **Symptom:** The `docker compose up --build` command failed with a DNS lookup error (`lookup registry-1.docker.io on 127.0.0.53:53: i/o timeout`).
*   **Root Cause:** This was identified as a transient local network issue on the host machine, preventing Docker from downloading the necessary base images.
*   **Resolution:** Retrying the build command was successful.

## 5. Current Problem: Unhealthy Container & "Site is Down"

After the successful build, the containers started and remained running. However, the application was still not functional.

*   **Symptom 1:** The user reported that "the site is down."
*   **Symptom 2:** Running `docker compose ps` revealed the `backend-1` container was `Up (unhealthy)`.
*   **Root Cause:** The container being "unhealthy" means its internal healthcheck is failing. This check attempts to curl the `/api/version` endpoint. The failure indicates that the Laravel application, while not crashing the container, is not running correctly and cannot respond to web requests.

## 6. Debugging Stalemate

Attempts to diagnose the unhealthy container have been difficult.

*   **Action:** The `docker compose logs backend` command was used to inspect the container's output for application errors.
*   **Problem:** The tool repeatedly returned truncated and incomplete logs, showing only the first few lines of the startup script. This prevented a direct view of the error that was causing the application to fail.
*   **Next Step:** The last attempted action before this summary was to bypass the logging issue by executing a command directly inside the container to read the Laravel log file (`storage/logs/laravel.log`).

## Conclusion

The initial race condition has been fixed, but it has been replaced by a new, currently undiagnosed application-level failure within the `backend` container. The primary obstacle to fixing it is the difficulty in retrieving the complete error logs.
